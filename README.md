## Autonomous AI-IPS (Intrusion Prevention System).

The main function of your application is to serve as an Autonomous AI-IPS (Intrusion Prevention System).

A standard firewall only blocks what you tell it to block; This app uses Machine Learning to "think" for itself—identifying and stopping attacks that have never been seen before (Zero-Day attacks).

## 🛡️ The 4 Core Pillars of the App
> 1. Real-Time Traffic Analysis (The Eyes): It constantly "sniffs" every piece of data entering your network. It does not just look at where the data is coming from; it looks at the behaviour (the timing, the size, and frequency of packets).

> 2. Intelligent Detection (The Brain): Using a Random Forest Machine Learning model, it compares live traffic against patterns of known "Benign" (safe) and "Malicious" (attack) traffic. It makes a probabilistic decision: "Is this a normal user, or is this a DoS attack?"

> 3. Automated Response (The Shield): If the AI is 95% certain it sees an attack, it doesn't just send an alert. It communicates directly with your Operating System’s Firewall to instantly block the attacker’s IP address, neutralising the threat before it can do damage.

> 4. Remote Monitoring (The Command Centre): It hosts a Web Dashboard that streams this data live. This allows security professionals to monitor the health of the network and see "kills" (blocked threats) in real-time from any device (PC, Phone, or Tablet).

## 💼 Professional Use Case
Imagine you are hosting a small web server. At 2:00 AM, a botnet starts flooding your server with requests.

Without this app, your server crashes, and you wake up to a broken website.

With this app, the AI detects the flood within 2 seconds, blocks the botnet's IPs, logs the event, and sends a notification to your dashboard—all while you are still asleep.

## 🏁 Final Summary
In short, this app replaces human observation with AI automation to protect a network from cyber threats 24/7.
